I love playing with numbers. I enjoy making beautiful, useful, and fun (sometimes funny) stuff particularly with personal and cultural data. With strong design and human-computer interaction research skills, I make data-driven products enabling exploratory data analytics and storytelling. Crossing borders of experience design, front-end engineering, and data analytics, I am a versatile professional who can research, design, and code in a collaborative work environment.

Currently I am a lead experience designer at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) focusing on designing internal products such as A/B testing tools and metric systems. Prior to that, I worked as a data visualization designer and visual analytics engineer at Meta. I hold a Ph.D. in Digital Media from Georgia Tech, where my research explored the rhetoric and aesthetics of visualization as a data-based cultural interface. I also have a background in Industrial Design from KAIST, Korea.

Outside of my professional work, I have a deep love for swimming. I work as a part-time assistant coach for Temescal Aquatics Masters in Oakland, California. Whenever I travel, I make it a point to checking out [public swimming pools](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1xSF1P30uBUzUx5PpX1M7iTLi8Ao&hl=en&femb=1&ll=0%2C0&z=1), as it's one of my favorite activities.

I have a dog named Juniper, and she's a [good girl](https://www.instagram.com/juniper.mongmong/).
