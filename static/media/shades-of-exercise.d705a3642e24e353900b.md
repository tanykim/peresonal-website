# Motivation

I wanted to gain a better understanding of my exercise habits throughout the year, with a focus on achieving a more balanced fitness routine. While I could track specific metrics like swimming distance or step count with [Quantify your year](https://hello.tany.kim/#/quantify-your-year) I desired a broader view of my overall exercise variety. 

# Datasets & Visualization

I utilized a straightforward dataset consisting of different exercise types, such as swimming, yoga, gym workouts, biking, and running, along with additional details, like the location of my yoga practice.

For visualization, I took inspiration from a calendar format. Each date on the calendar is displayed with a color that represents the exercise type performed that day. Typically, I engage in only one exercise type per day, though occasionally I do two. In such cases, the filled area for that day shows a combination of colors.

By tapping or hovering over each date, I can view the specific details of that exercise. Additionally, I wanted to emphasize inactive days in my routine. When I select an inactive day, the visualization highlights not only that day but also consecutive inactive days, generating a sense of accountability and motivation to stay consistent.

With this approach, I can gain insights into the variety and regularity of my exercise routines throughout the year, while also identifying periods of inactivity that may require attention.
