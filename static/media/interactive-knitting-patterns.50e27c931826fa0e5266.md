# Motivation

As I delved deeper into the world of knitting, I discovered a significant challenge that many beginners face, particularly when it comes to reading knitting instructions presented in traditional formats. These instructions are typically in the form of text filled with abbreviations or charts with symbols. While this is the norm in the knitting community, even experienced knitters can find it confusing to follow complex patterns that way.

#  Problems

## Text VS Chart
When it comes to knitting patterns, you may come across instructions that include both text and chart representations. However, it can sometimes be a bit challenging to match the symbols in the chart to the corresponding parts mentioned in the text, and vice versa. What's more, the direction of reading a row of a chart is different depending on how you knit; when you knit in the round, you always read from right to left, but when flat, you change direction the direction of reading between odd-numbered and even-numbered rows.

## Mix of various motifs
Many knitted garments, like beautiful Aran sweaters, feature different motifs like cable stitches. These motifs are often repeated across different numbers of rows (e.g., 4, 8, 12 rows). So, if you're eager to incorporate these motifs into your project, it can be tricky to calculate which rows belong to each motif. For example, on row 13, you might need to use 1 row of motif A, 5 rows of motif B, and 1 row of motif C.

# Solutions

## Highlight chart symbol & text part [(example)](https://knitting.tany.kim/#/pine-pullover/stitches/chart-A)
As a user sees both chart and text side by side, they can click on a symbol in the chart, the corresponding part in the text is highlighted, ensuring effortless matching between the two formats. Also a user has an option to switch direction. 

## Colors for various motifs [(example)](https://knitting.tany.kim/#/tiara-vest/pattern-by-size/back?size=2XS)
When multiple motifs are combined, they are distinguished in colors. When a user clicks a row of a garment pattern, they can see all stitches in the row are presented with the color of the motif.

## One size at a time 
Users can choose a size they want to follow, with a simple drop-down!

# Testimonials 
I published knitting patterns on the world's biggest knitting community site, [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/knitting). Many knitters left positive comments including:

# Future work

In traditional printed patterns, knitters often make handwritten notes to mark their progress and easily resume their projects at a later time. With interactive patterns, it's possible to provide a similar feature by allowing users to annotate their progress.

Many knitters still prefer having a printed copy, especially in situations where internet access is limited or unavailable. To accommodate these knitters, implementing a print-friendly layout for the pattern can be incredibly helpful. This ensures that the pattern can be easily printed without losing any readability or important formatting.

By incorporating both digital annotation capabilities and a print-friendly layout, interactive knitting patterns can cater to the preferences and needs of a wide range of knitters, enhancing their knitting experience both online and offline.
